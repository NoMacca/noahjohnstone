* Economic Factor
*** Contention
Surviving can be hard work. Every single one of your ancestors has successfully survived long enough to reproduce. So, you probably have a strong instinct to survive.

In order to survive, your behaviours are limited or constrained in a given context.

For your ancestors, they had to spend lots of their time securing food, finding or building shelter, and defending their resources.

In modernity, it is a different game. All you have to do is make some money, and you can trade it for all that survival stuff, food, shelter, etc.

You can make money in many ways, including activities unrelated to basic survival, like being a video game streamer. Ultimately, it comes down to convincing people to pay you, which can be done by providing genuine value or through persuasion and manipulation.

I'm going to argue that technology is significantly changing the ways we can earn money.

It is encroaching on the activities that used to make us money.
Additionally, it can encroach on activities that provide real value and can leave us having to make money by doing activities that rely on persuasion and manipulation.

I will argue by focusing solely on making money, we risk losing the long-term value these some activities provide.

I will argue that we need to consider preserving some of the valuable activities because they benefit individuals and society as a whole.

====
We will start by explaining how technology has influenced economic factors and changed what we can and cannot do.

The market brutally removes everything that is redundand and bloated.
Really inefficient processures survive because theire is a garuntee of resources.

We will look at some ways people make money that actually causes negative consequences to humans and society.

Then, I will look at how knowledge and skills are lost if there is no economic insentive for them to be learnt and practised.

I then want to explore how it is getting more and more difficult to being valuable enough to actually make money.

Lastly, I want to talk about how we can preserve some activities.

*** Technology has disrupted many industries making peoples knowledge and skills redundant.
A new piece of technology can mean that a human can do the job better and faster, and may not even be required anymore to do the job.

For instance, the use of industrial robots in automotive assembly lines has transformed the industry. These robots can perform tasks such as welding, painting, and assembling components with high precision and speed, often surpassing the capabilities of human workers.

Once the technology replaces humans in a task, the knowledge will be lost as there is no reason to use it.

For example, how many people do you know who can make a pair of shoes, catch a fish, skin a rabbit,

*** Lots of knowledge relies on complex technology for it to be valuable
A prompt engineer has to have a large complex langauge model
A software engineer requires a complex computer and the comple operating system.


*** Example were people do bad things for money

There are also activities that nobody really wants to do because of their risk or moral implications, but they are done due to economic incentives. For example, jobs in hazardous conditions such as coal mining or deep-sea fishing can be extremely dangerous, yet people undertake them because they pay well. Similarly, industries like tobacco farming or gambling often thrive despite their negative societal impacts, as they offer substantial financial rewards. These activities highlight how economic incentives can drive individuals to engage in work that they might otherwise avoid due to the associated risks or moral concerns.

*** Making it economically viable and its issues
If we think an activity is really worth doing, there are mechanisms to support it. For example, a philanthropist might fund a research facility to work on projects that may not yield immediate financial returns but could lead to significant discoveries later. Similarly, a government might grant money to a director to produce a film that would otherwise be unfunded. The military is an endeavour that is considered very important by many countries that it receives a large amount of funding.

While these supports can be highly valuable, they also come with potential issues. They can lead to reliance on external funding, bypassing the market's role in determining value. This centralises the decision of what is deemed valuable into the hands of the wealthy and powerful, rather than the consumer, and can create inefficiencies as individuals and organisations justify their worth in ways that the market might not support. Furthermore, there is a limited pool of such funding, leading to competition among recipients over how valuable they can appear.

Traditions

Bloat - there is a lot of administration wasted deciding on who is valuable.

Markets determine the value of something by many people making decisions together. You can also see this collective decision making and effort through certain things like: wikipedia, upvoting for content (youtube algorithsm), then ends up with content that is highly engaging.

The knowledge that a think can ultimely die is a harcore insentive to work hard and produce something that is valuable.

*** Loss of knowledge and skill
If there is no economic incentive to engage in an activity, people are unlikely to pursue it, and the skills or knowledge associated with that activity may diminish or disappear. For instance, consider the field of theoretical physics. Without sufficient funding and economic incentives, fewer people might choose to specialise in this area. However, theoretical physicists can be highly valuable to society. Their deep understanding of complex concepts might provide crucial insights when addressing related challenges, such as advancements in technology or solving energy problems. The absence of economic incentives can lead to a reduction in the number of experts in such fields, which might hinder society's ability to solve complex problems in the future. Therefore, even if the immediate economic benefits are not apparent, supporting these activities can be important for long-term societal progress.

*** More and more difficult to be valauble
As technology and society advance, it is becoming increasingly difficult to be economically valuable in a pure market. News reporters compete with the vast amount of online content, authors contend with an ever-growing archive of historical works, and knowledge workers face competition from increasingly advanced AI and a global economy. Soon, there will be very few activities that are economically viable for humans to pursue. If someone is valuable, they are very talented.
This shift could lead to a significant loss as the number of humans capable of performing these tasks decreases, resulting in a loss of valuable skills and knowledge. If we, as a society, have less knowledge, we become quite vulnerable.

*** Those that are econonomically valuable are talented or tricksters and cheats
Advertising can also make some activities economically viable by tricking the market (people) that something is worthwhile. Marketing will use srategoe.

*** Over service of goods and services




*** What should we do
To conclude, I think we need to think hard about what activities benefit individuals and society. In a self sustaining sosiety

We need to set up an economic reality were we can embrace new technologies without completely destroying our society.

Tradition of keeping certain knowledgte alive for a number of situations.

Work smarter not harder

If we think an activity is worth doing, we artificially make it profitable.
