The Teacher's Main Goal is to Change the Student's Long-Term Memory. To achieve this goal, teachers encourage activities that can facilitate this process, such as recalling information, thinking, writing, discussing, listening, moving, and reading.

To improve the likelihood that these activities will effectively change students' long-term memories, it's important to consider how such memories are formed. Key considerations include: Cognitive Load Theory, the limited capacity for new information, circadian rhythms, sufficient sleep, retrieval practice, interleaving, spaced repetition, deliberate practice, attention span, the impact of stress on learning, proper nutrition, and making learning enjoyable and fun.

In the article  [[https://andymatuschak.org/books/]["Why Books Don't Work"]], Andy Matushchak argues that effective learning requires a well-thought-out cognitive model for activities. He contends that traditional methods like reading books or listening to lectures do not align well with how humans form long-term memories. While books may be suitable for certain goals, they are not optimal for memory retention.

From my own experience, the activities that have significantly helped me form long-term memories include incremental reading, spaced repetition, and interleaving, particularly through the use of software applications like SuperMemo and Anki.
